				<strong>Design Decisions and Rationale:</strong>
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><p><strong>choosing topic ~ score: 0.5</strong> </p>By analyzing the aggregate number of cases in conjunction with the ethnicity demographics involved, it is possible to determine if there is an instance of ethnic targeting. Previous attempts to study the relationship between the duration of complaint case processing and ethnicity, as well as the relationship between types of complaint cases and ethnicity, did not reveal any significant differences. However, examining the objective data of the number of complaint cases (despite being based on the subjective complaints of the complainants, which is why the score is only 0.5) does reveal ethnic disparities.</li>
				<li><p><strong>choosing form ~ score: 2</strong> </p>Histograms can better represent the total number of cases. At the same time, rather than solely focusing on the ethnicity of the complainants, the inclusion of the officers' ethnicity allows readers to see that the unfair treatment of Black individuals is not due to conflicts within a single ethnicity. Instead, it is a common occurrence regardless of the officer's ethnicity, indicating that this type of ethnic inequality is widespread.</li>
				<li><p><strong>choosing color and reference line ~ score: 1</strong> </p>Using the average reference line, the graph starkly contrasts the number of unfair treatments Black individuals receive when enforced by law, which far exceeds that of other ethnicities, even to the extent of being double. The choice of red and blue colors to contrast White and Black individuals further facilitates information capture for readers.</li>

				<strong>Design Decisions and Rationale:</strong>
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><p><strong>choosing topic ~ score: -1 </strong></p>Presenting the number of appeals cases by different races as well as the success rate of these appeals. Despite a high number of appeals cases among the Black population, the low success rate can objectify the subjective act of filing an appeal—thereby creating an illusion: "There are many appeals cases among Black people, but the low rate of successful recognition suggests their appeals are less credible."</li>
				<li><p><strong>choosing form ~ score: -1.5 </strong></p>Use dots to represent the number of appeals cases, reducing the visual impact of the high number among Black people; at the same time, use histograms to emphasize the numerical value of their appeal success rate, indicating that the success rate of appeals among the Black community is not high. (Previously, scatter plots were also tried to represent the success rate, but such visual effects were more chaotic and did not allow readers to quickly grasp the phenomenon that the success rate of Black appeals is low.)</li>
				<li><p><strong>choosing reference line ~ score: 0.5</strong></p>By using a reference line for the average, it further contrasts that the success rate of Black appeals is always below average (regardless of the officer's race), causing readers to doubt the subjectivity of their appeals. (It should be noted that there has been specific verification that the distribution of appeal case types among Black people is relatively even, thus controlling the variable of case type.)</li>
				<li>*Ensure that the racial color legends are consistent between the two graphs to facilitate comparison.</li>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>When presenting arguments for and against the same topic, I believe that the evidence supporting the argument tends to be more straightforward—that is, the number of appeal cases can show that the New York Police Department exhibits certain unjust behaviors towards the Black community during law enforcement. However, when seeking evidence to the contrary, I think one approach is to directly refute the number of appeal cases through different visualization methods (which may be somewhat deceptive). But due to the large number of appeal cases filed by the Black community, it's quite apparent from any angle, making it difficult to argue from this perspective. Therefore, I chose to approach it from another angle, whether we can directly judge racial fairness based on such a subjective number of appeals? Here, I utilized another important variable: the situation of appeal success. However, if only the number of successful cases is visualized, the number involving Black individuals still leads significantly (due to a large base), which cannot serve as good contrary evidence. Thus, I chose to use the data on the success rate of appeals to imply that there might be a certain subjective tendency, hoping to mislead the audience into thinking, "Although there are many appeals cases among Black people, they are mostly their subjective thoughts, and not necessarily many occur objectively," thereby constituting contrary evidence.</p>
      <p>I consider such argumentation to be "acceptable" persuasive, because the affirmative argument does indeed have some subjectivity (i.e., judging based on the number of subjective appeals); and the variable of the appeal success rate does indeed have some objective reference value, so I do not regard this as "misleading." Also, I have indeed felt the importance of presuppositions throughout the process. Racial discrimination is an event difficult to judge objectively, and after trying to analyze other variables (such as case review duration/case category, etc.), I found that there is actually not much difference between ethnicities; at the same time, I discovered that even within the same ethnicity, there is no "mutual care," meaning officers of the same race are not necessarily more friendly towards their own people: this was actually quite surprising to me. Therefore, I have come to understand more deeply how difficult it is for a marginalized group to argue that they have been treated unfairly, because the opposing side can always find a variety of variables to prove that no unfairness exists.</p>
